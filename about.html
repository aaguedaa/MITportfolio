                        <p>
                            Welcome to my portfolio! I am Agueda, an artist with a burgeoning passion for programming. My journey into the world of code began as a means to expand my artistic toolkit, aiming to build innovative websites, applications, and tools that enhance my art.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        My dual interest in art and technology has led me to explore the intersection of creativity and functionality. I'm currently focusing on web development, using this platform to showcase not only my coding skills but also how technology can serve as a canvas for artistic expression.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently pursuing a Professional Certificate in Full Stack Development with a focus on the MERN stack through a program offered by MIT in collaboration with X-Pro. This program is equipping me with a comprehensive skill set for modern web development, which includes:

                        <p>
                            My vision is to use technology not just as a tool for creation but as an integral part of the creative process itself. I see programming as an extension of my artistic practice, where each line of code is like a brush stroke on a digital canvas, capable of bringing ideas to life in ways traditional art cannot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I'm excited to share my journey with you and am always looking for new opportunities to learn, collaborate, and grow in this ever-evolving field. If you're interested in discussing potential projects, collaborations, or simply want to talk about the blend of art and technology, feel free to reach out. Let's create something extraordinary together.
